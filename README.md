## About the code:  
Lets the user draw a polygon on the screen
when the user is done
the polygon will be colored in a random color and its area will be shown

## Limitations of the Code:  
The code works on polygons in their basic definition and not on self intersecting polygons.

## Sample Image:  
![polygon](/images/polygon.png)
